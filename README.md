This code implements a basic keylogger using Tkinter for the GUI and pynput for capturing keyboard events. It logs pressed, held, and released keys in both a text file (key_log.txt) and a JSON file (key_log.json). The GUI allows starting and stopping the keylogger with buttons, updating the display to indicate the current status.
